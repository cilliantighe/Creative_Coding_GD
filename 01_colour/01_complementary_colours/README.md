## Complementary Colours

### HSB
In this sketch, the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) colour scale is used. HSB allows more control over the desired colour. 

### contrain()
Mousex and MouseY are key words in P5.js. They output the x and y location of the mouse in relation to the canvas. 
In order to make sure that the output of the MouseX and MouseY is controlled, they are both constrained using the constrain() function.

### map()
In this sketch, the map() function is used to output a desired number in a range. The map() function in this sketch is used to on the MouseX and MouseY to output values from 0 - 360. The reason for this is that we set the hue range to 360 in the setup. This means that they're see 360 colours to output.

### fill()
